* Python Dissemination

A lesson on the dissemination of Python code as scripts and packages,
implemented using the [[https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/][The Carpentries Workbench]], sourced from org-mode files.

# TODO(rg): setup a complete post on the org-mode stuff, currently just a snippet

#+begin_src bash
# setup locally
gh repo clone HaoZeke/python_packaging_workbench
cd python_packaging_workbench
pixi s
# serve locally
Rscript -e 'sandpaper::serve()'
#+end_src

# ** TODO cleaner generation from org->md
# i.e. do it in CI and on a separate branch instead of commiting both to the
# ~main~.
** References
While opinionated, the materials also take from existing community resources. Contributions welcome.
