This lesson teaches how to share Python code, both in the form of packages, and
reproducible scripts. The teaching philosophy is to cover "good enough"
practices, with more content linked out when necessary.

#+begin_prereq

- [ ] Basic understanding of Python syntax
- [ ] Basic understanding of Shell scripts

Knowledge of the interactive terminal or a [[https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/][Jupyter instance]] suffices.

#+begin_src python
a = [3,5,6.0]

def mysquarer(_a):
    for x in _a:
        x=x**2
    return _a

mysquarer(a)

Navigation of the file system through a terminal will suffice, as well as
remembering that *everything is a file* on Unix systems, as far as the contents
of the lesson at any rate.

#+begin_src bash :eval never
# get files in directory
ls
# get directory name
pwd
# view first few lines of a file
head readme.org
#+end_src
