* Overall Lesson Design

This lesson follows a progressive arc from standalone scripts to published
packages with compiled extensions. Each episode builds on the previous one, so
it is important to teach them in order. The full lesson spans eight episodes
with approximately 3 hours of instruction plus 1.5 hours of exercises, suitable
for a full-day workshop. A half-day workshop can cover the first five episodes
(through Release Engineering), with the remaining three assigned as self-study.

The running example is a small computational chemistry library (=chemlib=) that
evolves from a single script into a full package with Fortran extensions. You do
not need domain expertise to teach this lesson; the chemistry content is
deliberately minimal and serves only as a realistic motivating example.

* Before the Workshop

- Ensure learners have =pixi= and =uv= installed (see the Setup page).
- Ask learners to create a [[https://test.pypi.org/account/register/][Test PyPI]] account before arriving.
- Have a working internet connection; several episodes download packages.
- Pre-download the example data files if you expect connectivity issues.

* Episode-Specific Notes

** Writing Reproducible Python (20 min teaching / 10 min exercises)

- Start by asking learners how they currently share scripts. This surfaces the
  pain points that the lesson addresses.
- The inline script metadata (PEP 723) feature requires =uv= and may be
  unfamiliar even to experienced Python users. Emphasize that this is a new
  standard and not yet widely adopted.
- The =pixi= task runner integration is optional but useful for showing how
  system-level dependencies (like =ase=) can be pinned alongside Python
  dependencies.

** Modules, Packages, and The Search Path (15 min teaching / 5 min exercises)

- Learners often confuse "module" (a single =.py= file) with "package" (a
  directory with =__init__.py=). Draw the distinction clearly.
- The =sys.path= inspection is the key conceptual moment. Have learners run it
  interactively and compare outputs.
- Common misconception: learners may believe =import= searches the entire
  filesystem. Clarify that it only searches =sys.path= entries.

** The Project Standard: pyproject.toml (20 min teaching / 10 min exercises)

- This is the densest episode. Consider a short break before it.
- The =src= layout is non-obvious to beginners. Explain that it prevents
  accidental imports from the working directory instead of the installed package.
- Walk through the =uv init= output slowly; there is a lot of generated content.
- If learners ask about =setup.py= or =setup.cfg=, acknowledge them as legacy
  approaches and redirect to =pyproject.toml= as the current standard (PEP 621).

** Quality Assurance: Testing and Linting (20 min teaching / 10 min exercises)

- Learners often resist testing because their code "works." Frame testing as a
  way to save time when refactoring or onboarding new collaborators.
- =ruff= is fast enough to run live. Consider showing a side-by-side of
  before/after formatting.
- The =--dev= flag for development dependencies is a critical concept. Make sure
  learners understand why linters and test frameworks should not be runtime
  dependencies.

** Release Engineering: Logs and Artifacts (25 min teaching / 15 min exercises)

- The =towncrier= fragment workflow may feel heavyweight for small projects.
  Acknowledge this and explain that it scales well for multi-contributor
  projects.
- Publishing to Test PyPI is the highlight of this episode. Have learners
  actually publish and then install each other's packages if time permits.
- Common issue: package name collisions on Test PyPI. Have learners use unique
  suffixes (e.g., =chemlib-<username>=).

** If It Isn't Documented, It Doesn't Exist (25 min teaching / 15 min exercises)

This episode focuses on docstrings and Sphinx. It assumes learners already have
a working, tested package with a release pipeline.

- Start with docstrings, not Sphinx. The "write a NumPy-style docstring"
  exercise gives learners an immediate, tangible skill even if they never set
  up Sphinx.
- Sphinx configuration can feel overwhelming. The episode uses a minimal
  =conf.py= with only three extensions: =autoapi=, =viewcode=, and
  =intersphinx=. Resist the urge to add more.
- The Shibuya theme is recommended for its clean modern look, but any theme
  works. If learners prefer Read the Docs, that is fine.
- The =intersphinx= challenge is a "wow" moment for many learners. Show how
  a =:class:`numpy.ndarray`= reference in a docstring automatically becomes a
  hyperlink to the NumPy documentation.
- Common issue: the =sys.path.insert= line in =conf.py= must point to the
  correct relative path for your =src= directory. If =autoapi= finds zero
  modules, this is almost always the cause.
- The GitHub Pages deployment section introduces GitHub Actions workflow files.
  Keep it brief; the next episode (CI) covers workflow files in full detail.
- The PR preview subsection uses a two-workflow pattern (build + comment). If
  learners ask why, explain the security model: the build runs with the PR
  author's limited permissions, while the comment workflow runs with write
  access only after a successful build. This prevents malicious PRs from
  exploiting elevated permissions.
- If time is short, the PR preview can be skipped or shown as a demo.
  The core value of the episode is docstrings + Sphinx + autoapi.

** The Gatekeeper: Continuous Integration (20 min teaching / 10 min exercises)

This episode follows naturally from Quality Assurance (local hooks) and Release
Engineering (manual publishing). It closes the loop by automating both. Learners
will have already seen a workflow file in the Documentation episode, so the YAML
structure should not be entirely new.

- Many learners will not have used GitHub Actions before. Start by explaining
  the YAML structure: =on= (triggers), =jobs= (what runs), =steps= (how).
  The episode includes a "Reading the Workflow" challenge for this purpose.
- The =astral-sh/setup-uv= action is the recommended way to install =uv= in
  CI. Emphasize the =enable-cache: true= flag, which dramatically speeds up
  repeated runs.
- Build up from a single-OS pipeline to the matrix. This avoids overwhelming
  learners with the full YAML in one go.
- The matrix strategy is the key concept. Show the math: 2 Python versions x
  3 operating systems = 6 parallel jobs. This is where CI earns its keep.
- The release job at the end ties back to =uvx twine= from Release Engineering.
  Emphasize that =needs: check= means a broken build is never published.
- Common issue: Windows path separators. If a learner has hardcoded =/= in
  file paths, the Windows job will fail. This loops back to =pathlib= from
  the very first episode.
- If time is short, skip the matrix and just show the basic single-OS pipeline.
  The matrix can be assigned as homework.

** Compiled Extensions: The Shared Object Pipeline (35 min teaching / 15 min exercises)

This is the most advanced episode and serves as the capstone of the lesson. By
this point learners have the full toolchain (packaging, testing, docs, CI) and
are ready to tackle the binary distribution problem.

- Gauge the audience and consider making it optional for a shorter workshop.
- Learners without Fortran experience should not worry; the Fortran code is
  provided and the focus is on the build pipeline, not the language.
- The =meson-python= backend is less common than =setuptools=. Explain that it
  exists specifically for compiled code and is used by =numpy= and =scipy=.
- =cibuildwheel= can take a long time to run in CI. Consider showing
  pre-recorded output if live demos are not feasible. Learners now understand
  CI from the previous episode, so the =cibuildwheel= matrix diagram should
  feel familiar.
- The "manual install" challenge (copying =.so= into =site-packages=) is
  deliberately low-level. It demystifies what =pip install= actually does
  under the hood and helps learners appreciate why build tools exist.
- If a learner's system lacks a Fortran compiler, they can still follow along
  conceptually; the =f2py= output is shown in the lesson.

* Suggested Workshop Schedules

** Half-Day Workshop (3.5 hours, episodes 1-5)

| Time          | Activity                          |

This covers the core "script to published package" arc. Documentation, CI, and
Compiled Extensions can be assigned as self-study or covered in a follow-up
session.

** Shorter Session (2 hours, episodes 1-4)

Cover Scripts through Quality Assurance. This gives learners a complete workflow
from script to tested package and can be done without internet access (no
publishing step).

|------------------------+----------+-----------+--------|
| *Total*                | *180 min* | *90 min* | *270 min* |

For a half-day workshop (3.5 hours with breaks), the first five episodes
(through Release Engineering) fit comfortably. For a shorter session, stop after
Quality Assurance. For a full-day workshop, cover all eight episodes with
Documentation and CI in the late morning and Compiled Extensions after lunch.

* Common Pitfalls

- Learners on Windows may have PATH issues with =pixi= and =uv= after
  installation. Have them restart their terminal.
- Virtual environment confusion: some learners may have =conda= environments
  active that interfere with =uv=. Ask them to deactivate first.
- The =editable install= concept (=uv pip install -e .=) is powerful but can
  confuse learners who expect changes to require reinstallation. Clarify when
  editable installs do and do not pick up changes (new files require reinstall).
- TestPyPI name collisions: package names are global. Have learners append a
  unique suffix (e.g., =chemlib-<username>=) to avoid conflicts.
- Fortran compiler availability: not all systems have =gfortran= installed.
  On macOS, learners may need to install it via =brew install gcc= or use
  =pixi= to provide it. On Windows, =pixi= is the recommended path.
- The =uv run= vs =python= distinction trips up learners who are used to
  activating virtual environments. Emphasize that =uv run= is the "batteries
  included" way to execute code in the project's environment.
- If GitHub Actions workflows do not trigger, check that the YAML file is in
  the default branch and that the file is valid YAML (indentation matters).
- =ruff= version pinning: the =.pre-commit-config.yaml= pins a =ruff= version.
  If learners see different lint results locally vs in CI, version mismatch
  is usually the cause.

* Accessibility and Inclusivity

- All diagrams in the lesson have alt-text descriptions. If projecting slides,
  read the diagram aloud for visually impaired learners.
- The lesson uses colour-coded diagrams. Ensure your projector has adequate
  contrast, and point out the labels rather than relying on colour alone.
- Terminal font size: increase your terminal font to at least 18pt when
  live-coding so learners at the back can follow along.
- Provide the example data files on a USB stick or shared drive if
  connectivity is unreliable.
