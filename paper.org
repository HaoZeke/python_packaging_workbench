* Summary

Python packaging has improved in leaps and bounds over the years. System
dependency management has also become routine through the community-wide
adoption of the ~conda~ packaging ecosystem. In particular, with the Rust-based
[[cite:&perkelWhyScientistsAre2020]] stack of ~uv~ and ~pixi~
[[cite:&fischerPixiUnifiedSoftware2025]], it is now possible to rapidly iterate on
multi-lingual software with complex dependencies. "Python Dissemination"
constitutes an intermediate-level curriculum designed to first demonstrate such
scripting, and then the transition from self contained artifacts into packages
to be used by the wider community. Developed within The Carpentries Workbench
infrastructure, the lesson targets scientists who have mastered basic syntax and
are able to interact with libraries [fn:: occasionally assisted in their
installation by systems administrators] but lack a rigorous mental model of the
software distribution lifecycle. The curriculum deconstructs the complexities of
packaging, separates abstract dependency declaration from concrete environment
resolution, and can be covered within a single afternoon for dedicated learners,
including an understanding of compiled extensions and their installation within
Python packages.

* Statement of Need

Scripts are the most natural extension of a basic introduction to programming in
Python. Even for those learning on interactive Jupyter notebooks, the script
[fn:: sometimes exported from a notebook] forms the unit of communication
between learners. In practice, scripts written in this manner suffer from being
dependent on locally installed environmental dependencies. Modern tooling does
allow for scripts to be self contained even when system dependencies are
involved, and this forms the first part of the lesson.

Beyond this, intermediate courses also rarely address the "packaging
gradient"—the structural transformation required to convert a local script into
a distributable library. Packaging is often left to tutorials at workshops and
other niche setups, often without the benefit of the pedagogical understanding
gained in the last few decades, like those known from the Carpentries
[[cite:&wilsonSoftwareCarpentryGetting2006;&tealDataCarpentryWorkshops2015]].

We identify three specific barriers to entry that this curriculum dismantles:

-  The Shadowing Fallacy :: Novices often lack a clear mental model of Python's
  import resolution (~sys.path~), leading to fragile code that breaks when moved
  from the development directory [fn:: exacerbated by "inherited" shell configurations].
-  The Reproducibility Hysteresis :: Traditional tooling often conflates
  *specification* (what the code needs) with *resolution* (what the machine
  installed), leading to environments that drift over time.
-  The Compilation Barrier :: Compiled extensions dominate performance oriented
  Python code. General-purpose tutorials typically ignore the concepts
  underlying the build systems required to bridge these languages with Python,
  despite the tools themselves having fairly decent documentation.

This lesson adopts a "Good Enough Practices" philosophy
cite:wilsonGoodEnoughPractices, with tooling for modern standards that enforce
correctness by default.

* Pedagogical Design

The instructional design follows a spiral trajectory, revisiting the concept of
"dependencies" at increasing levels of abstraction, for both practical scripts
to packages meant to be installed by end-users as shown in Figure
ref:fig:pedagogical-gradient. We employ visual mental models to anchor these
concepts.

Starting with the most immediate example of a script, we discuss PEP 723
tooling, demonstrating how a script may now carry its own context. By leveraging
system dependencies through ~pixi~ and Python inline metadata with ~uv~ with
specific examples, learners gain confidence in the ability to share reproducible
scripts as shown in Figure ref:fig:hybrid-env.

The curriculum then moves towards a standard self-contained understanding of
the Python import system, using the ~src~ layout generated from ~uv~ and
demonstrates how this prevents the "works on my machine" syndrome caused by
implicit relative imports. This is followed by an understanding of automated
testing, linting, formatting, and release management including challenges for
TestPyPI.

A distinct feature of this curriculum involves the explicit handling of compiled
extensions. With the promulgation of Rust-in-Python, along with the traditional
Fortran-in-Python and C/C++-in-Python, many high performance libraries involve
such components. ~scikit-build~ for CMake projects, ~meson-python~ for Meson
projects, and the venerable ~setuptools~, all have fairly decent documentation.
What is missing, especially when considering ~maturin~ and other "all-in-one"
project layouts, is a first principles understanding of the process and logic
behind exposing shared libraries and the use of wheels. We cover this gap, as demonstrated with an ~f2py~ example, conceptualized in Figure ref:fig:build_flow.

* Instructional Experience & Infrastructure

We implement this curriculum using The Carpentries Workbench, albeit with a
modified ~orgmode~ source to generate figures and the ~RMarkdown~ required. This
infrastructure affords several advantages:
- Maintainability :: The separation of narrative prose from code snippets allows
  for atomic updates to the tooling stack without rewriting the pedagogical
  logic.
- Accessibility :: The workbench rendering ensures the material remains
  accessible across diverse devices, with specialized handling for generating
  all-in-one pages, challenges, hints, key points and other concepts.

The choice of the ~uv~ and ~ruff~ toolchain specifically targets the reduction
of "installation friction" in workshops. By utilizing single-binary tools that
require no system-level dependencies, we minimize the time spent debugging
learner environments, maximizing the time spent on conceptual synthesis.
Taken together, we believe this material empowers learners to generate
reproducible results [[cite:&sandveTenSimpleRules2013]] and distribute code
effectively as per the FAIR principles [[cite:&barkerIntroducingFAIRPrinciples2022;&communityTuringWayHandbook2019]].
